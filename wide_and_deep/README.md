# Wide and Deep Networks
 
## About this Project

Our goal for this project is to use varied deep learning architectures including wide and deep architectures to create a neural network model that can accurately predict the monetary value of soccer players based on the characteristics of said player.
 
## Dataset & Dependencies

Our dataset can be found on Kaggle by following this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjeetsinghnaik/fifa-23-players-dataset

We use the following Python/JupyterNotebook libraries in our work: 
* TensorFlow and Keras to create our model architecture.
* Scikit-learn for model evaluation and data processing.
* Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.
* Other essential libraries include NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.

 
## Technical Approach

First, we engineer our feature set for analysis. Then, we run exploratory data analysis on our data. Now that we have a better understanding of our dataset, we create our neural networks. This is our first project using TensorFlow rather than building all of our models from scratch. Therefore, the purpose of this lab is to understand the basics of how to use TensorFlow to create base multi-layered perceptron models. Next, we create different MLP model architectures including MLP with different numbers of layers. We use both sparse and dense branches to help improve our models generalization. After creating our different models, we choose our best performing model and tune its hyperparameters to maximize performance. Finally, we plot the area under the curve and further analyze the performance of our models.
 
## Highlights

* Wide and deep networks
* EDA
* TensorFlow and Keras
* Imbalanced dataset
 
## Conclusion

This project was our first time using TensorFlow, so it was a lot easier using a machine learning library rather than building everything from hand. Additionally, wide and deep networks improve the generalization and reduce memorization of a model.
